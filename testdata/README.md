# Parquet Example Files

These are files I have found on the internet that I am using to test and understand the Parquet format.
One of the most useful tools I've found is to use [parqeye](https://github.com/kaushiksrini/parqeye), which is a
command line utility that gives you an overview of Parquet files (which is also written in Rust :D).

## Subdirectories

- `timestored_examples`: These are files pulled directly from [TimeStored](https://www.timestored.com/data/sample/parquet).
